# Interactive-clustering
Document clustering serves as an effective means to gain understanding from extensive text collections. Despite the efficiency of fully automatic algorithms, their inability to accurately capture user perspectives in cluster formation is evident due to the personalized nature of this process. In this project, we introduce an innovative visual analytics system designed for interactive document clustering. Our system is built upon clustering algorithms that can adapt to user feedback. Initially, clusters are generated based on the user-specified number and a chosen clustering algorithm. Subsequently, the clustering outcome is presented visually to the user. A suite of coordinated visualization modules and document projection is crafted to assist the user in gaining deeper insights into the document collection and clusters. Through an iterative process, users can modify clusters and key terms, providing feedback to the clustering algorithm until achieving a satisfactory result. In key-term based interaction, users assign a set of key terms to each target cluster to guide the clustering algorithm. We have conducted a series of quantitative experiments, a use case, and a user study to demonstrate the advantages of our approach in document analytics based on clustering.
